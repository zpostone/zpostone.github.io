    <p>Hello, I am a graduate student in MITâ€™s Department of Urban Studies and Planning. I'm interested in opportunities to bridge visualization and interaction design with the physical design disciplines.</p>
    <p> My recent projects include mapping evictions in Boston and developing urban design strategies for high-vacancy areas in the outskirts of Mexico City. I studied Political Science at Swarthmore College, and have previously worked with design and urbanism organizations including Van Alen Institute, The Center for Urban Pedagogy, Architizer, and Local Projects.</p>

    <p>I'm currently inspired by: <a href="http://legislativeexplorer.org/" target="_blank">Legislative Explorer</a></p>
